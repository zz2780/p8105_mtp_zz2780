Problem 1 - Data

The raw data has variables and observations. Under the columns Raison,
Simone, Gagne are the weights recorded for each dog on different dates.
And std represents the standard object’s weight. Some dates contain
notes recorded that day. The goal of this report this to tidy the data
set, conduct descriptive analysis, and produce a graphic output for the
distribution of each dog’s weight and their trends over time.

For the first data frame that contains weights of each dog and the dates
recorded, I first imported the table from the excel sheet and omitted
the Notes section. After I cleaned the columns’ names, I realized that
variables recording the weights contained two values, one in lb and one
in oz, separated by space. After separating the two numbers in one
variable into two and converting them into numeric characters, I combine
the two columns with same unit in lb for Raison, Simone, Gagne, and the
standard object, which were rounded to two decimal places. Then I
dropped all the intermediate variables and only kept weights in lb for
Raison, Simone, Gagne, their std, and the dates recorded. After tidying
the variables for weights, I noticed that there were some dates when
there was no record for all variables, so I deleted rows where there is
ONLY date recorded.

Since the column names of dogs and standard object is also a variable, I
pivoted the table so that there is a variable called Name, including
values Raisin, Simone, Gagne, and std, and the second variable Weight
with each object’s weight recorded on that date. Finally I converted the
numeric values of dates to modern date format. The first data frame is
exported with the name “dataframe1.csv” in the data folder along with
the raw data.

``` r
data=read_excel("data/dogweights_07may2022.xlsx", range="B2:F363" )
data1<-data%>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col=raisin, into=c("raison_lb", "raison_oz"), sep=" ")%>%
  separate(col=simone, into=c("simone_lb", "simone_oz"), sep=" ")%>%
  separate(col=gagne, into=c("gagne_lb", "gagne_oz"), sep=" ")%>%
  separate(col=std, into=c("std_lb", "std_oz"), sep=" ")%>%
  transform(
            raison_lb=as.numeric(raison_lb),
            raison_oz=as.numeric(raison_oz),
            simone_lb=as.numeric(simone_lb),
            simone_oz=as.numeric(simone_oz),
            gagne_lb=as.numeric(gagne_lb),
            gagne_oz=as.numeric(gagne_oz),
            std_lb=as.numeric(std_lb),
            std_oz=as.numeric(std_oz)
  )%>%
  mutate(
    raison=round(raison_lb+0.0625*raison_oz,2),
    simone=round(simone_lb+0.0625*simone_oz,2),
    gagne=round(gagne_lb+0.0625*gagne_oz,2),
    std=round(std_lb+0.0625*std_oz,2)
  )%>%
  select(date, raison, simone, gagne, std)%>%
  subset(!is.na(raison)|!is.na(simone)|!is.na(gagne)|!is.na(std))%>%
  pivot_longer(
    raison:std,
    names_to="name",
    values_to="weight"
  )

data1$date=excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(data1$date), date_system="modern")

write.csv(data1, "data/dataframe1.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

The second data frame was selected from the same excel sheet. After
cleaning the name, I copied the column of notes and gave the new column
name “Notes”. I also changed the numeric date format to modern format.
And I only selected the variables of notes written as text and dates
recorded. I also removed rows that both date and notes are N.A. I
exported the second data frame as “dataframe2.csv” to the data folder
along with the raw data and dataframe1.

``` r
data2=read_xlsx("data/dogweights_07may2022.xlsx", range="B2:G363" )%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(Notes=x6,
         date=excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(date), date_system="modern")
         )%>%
  select(date, Notes)%>%
  subset(!is.na(date)|!is.na(Notes))
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...6`

``` r
write.csv(data2, "data/dataframe2.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

Problem 2 - EDA The resulting tidy data set contains 1428 observations
and 3 observations. Variables are recorded date, dog’s name, and
corresponding weight.

``` r
data1%>%
  count(date, name="n_obs")%>%
  na.omit()
```

    ## # A tibble: 356 × 2
    ##    date       n_obs
    ##    <date>     <int>
    ##  1 2018-08-12     4
    ##  2 2018-08-19     4
    ##  3 2018-08-22     4
    ##  4 2018-08-24     4
    ##  5 2018-08-27     4
    ##  6 2018-08-29     4
    ##  7 2018-08-31     4
    ##  8 2018-09-02     4
    ##  9 2018-09-03     4
    ## 10 2018-09-04     4
    ## # … with 346 more rows

356 distinct dates are include in the dataset after omitting the one
N.A. date.

The table below recorded the number of observations for each dog, and
their average weight and standard deviation. Gagne has 119 recorded
weights, with mean of 10.29lb, and sd of 0.71lb. Raison has 352 recorded
weights, with an average of 17.78lb, and sd of 0.94lb. Simone has 333
recorded weights, with an average of 9.79 and 0.92 standard deviation.
The standard object has 45 recorded weights, with an average of 20.98lb
and standard deviation of 0.01.

``` r
table1<-data1%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  summarize(
    n_obs=n(),
    avg_weight=round(mean(weight),2),
    sd_weight=round(sd(weight),2)
  )
table1
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   name   n_obs avg_weight sd_weight
    ##   <chr>  <int>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 gagne    119      10.3       0.71

    ## 3 simone   333       9.79      0.92
    ## 4 std       45      21.0       0.01
